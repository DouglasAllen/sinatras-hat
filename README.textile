h1. Sinatra's Hat

Easy REST-ful apps with Sinatra.

Using Sinatra's Hat is centered around the @mount@ method, which is
added to @Sinatra::Base@. It takes at bare minimum a model class. This
class will be mounted as a REST-ful resource, giving you all the CRUD
actions, as well as @new@ and @edit@ actions. Let's look at some code:

<pre>
mount Article
</pre>

Now you've basically got the same functionality as you'll get in Rails
by running @script/generate scaffold Article@. The views for your @Article@
will live in @views/articles@, and be named @index.erb@, @show.erb@, etc.

Go ahead, try it.
